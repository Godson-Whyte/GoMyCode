      <p>Getting Started with Python Programming
        Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers. Getting Started with Python is easy due to its straightforward syntax and extensive documentation, which provides ample resources for learning and development.</p><br><br>
        <strong>Python Features</strong><br>
        <p>Here are some of the key features of Python:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>Interpreted: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the Python code is executed line by line. This makes it easy to test and debug code.</li> <br>
        <li>High-Level: <pre><code>Python</code></pre>  is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away low-level details like memory management and hardware interaction. This makes it easier to write and understand code.</li><br>
        <li>High-Level: <pre><code>Python</code></pre> is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away low-level details like memory management and hardware interaction. This makes it easier to write and understand code.</li><br>
         <li>Dynamic: <pre><code>Python</code></pre> is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable can be changed at runtime.</li><br>
         <li>Strong Typing: <pre><code>Python</code></pre>  is strongly typed, which means that the data type of a variable is enforced at runtime.</li><br>
         <li>Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides tools and modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and more.</li><br>
         <li>Cross-Platform: Python is a cross-platform language, which means that <pre><code>Python</code></pre> code can run on different operating systems without modification.</li> <br>
         <li>Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community, which contributes to its ecosystem.</li><br>
         <li>Versatile: Python is a versatile language that can be used for various purposes, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, game development, and more.</li><br><br>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Getting Started with Python</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Install Python</li>
          <li>Setting up a Python Development Environment</li> 
          <li>Create and Run your First Python Program</li>
          <li>Python Basic Guide</li>
          <li>Beginner Tips for Learning Python Programming</li> 
        
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Here’s a basic guide to get you started with Python:</strong><br>
        <b>Install Python</b>
        <p>First, you need to install Python on your computer. To install Python on your computer, follow these steps:</p>
        
        Download Python: Go to the official Python website at <pre><code><a href="https://www.python.org/"></a></code></pre> On the homepage, you will see a “Downloads” section. Click on the “Download Python” button.
        Choose the Version: You will be directed to a page where you can choose the version of Python you want to download. Python usually has two main versions available: Python 3. Python 3 is the recommended version. Click on the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
        Add Python to PATH (Optional): On Windows, you may be given the option to add Python to your system’s PATH environment variable. This makes it easier to run Python from the command line. If you’re not sure, it’s usually safe to select this option.
        Install Python: Click the “Install Now” button to begin the installation. The installer will copy the necessary files to your computer.
        Verify the Installation: After the installation is complete, you can verify that Python was installed correctly by opening a command prompt (on Windows) or a terminal (on macOS or Linux) and typing python --version. This should display the version of Python you installed.</p>
